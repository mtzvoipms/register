Armenia's [Multi-Sector Register](https://www.e-register.am/en/) was launched in 2020 to collect beneficial ownership data.

This followed [significant support](https://openownershiporgprod-1b54.kxcdn.com/media/documents/oo-report-armenia-scoping-report-2020-08.pdf) that Open Ownership gave to the Armenian government agencies overseeing the country's beneficial ownership reform process during 2019 and 2020.

In June 2021 the government passed a new series of laws - [Law HO-246-N](https://www.arlis.am/DocumentView.aspx?DocID=153756) and [Law HO-247-N](https://www.arlis.am/DocumentView.aspx?DocID=153772) - to unify its legal definition and update its beneficial ownership regime.

With an initial focus on extractive industry companies, the Multi-Sector Register [captures and publishes data](https://www.openownership.org/en/blog/armenia-and-latvia-become-first-countries-to-publish-data-in-line-with-the-beneficial-ownership-data-standard/) in line with the [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](https://standard.openownership.org/) developed by Open Ownership in partnership with Open Data Services. It also makes use of the open source [Beneficial Ownership Data Standard visualisation library](https://www.openownership.org/en/publications/beneficial-ownership-data-standard-visualisation-library/) to create automatic diagrams of beneficial ownership networks.

During 2023, the scope of the Multi-Sector Register expanded to companies operating in other sectors across the economy.

To demonstrate how the collection of standardised beneficial ownership data in line with the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard helps countries leverage a range of open source tools, Open Ownership has incorporated data disclosed by a number of [extractive industry companies listed by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) team in Armenia](https://www.eiti.am/hy/%D4%BB%D5%8D-%D5%B0%D5%A1%D5%B5%D5%BF%D5%A1%D6%80%D5%A1%D6%80%D5%A1%D5%A3%D5%A5%D6%80/?tab=88) into the Open Ownership Register.
